### Feature engineering is the pre-processing step of machine learning, which is used to transform raw data into features that can be used for creating a predictive model using Machine learning or statistical Modelling. Feature engineering in machine learning aims to improve the performance of models.
Feature engineering is the pre-processing step of machine learning, which extracts features from raw data. It helps to represent an underlying problem to predictive models in a better way, which as a result, improve the accuracy of the model for unseen data. The predictive model contains predictor variables and an outcome variable, and while the feature engineering process selects the most useful predictor variables for the model.

Feature Engineering for Machine Learning
Since 2016, automated feature engineering is also used in different machine learning software that helps in automatically extracting features from raw data. Feature engineering in ML contains mainly four processes: Feature Creation, Transformations, Feature Extraction, and Feature Selection.

These processes are described as below:

Feature Creation: Feature creation is finding the most useful variables to be used in a predictive model. The process is subjective, and it requires human creativity and intervention. The new features are created by mixing existing features using addition, subtraction, and ration, and these new features have great flexibility.
Transformations: The transformation step of feature engineering involves adjusting the predictor variable to improve the accuracy and performance of the model. For example, it ensures that the model is flexible to take input of the variety of data; it ensures that all the variables are on the same scale, making the model easier to understand. It improves the model's accuracy and ensures that all the features are within the acceptable range to avoid any computational error.
Feature Extraction: Feature extraction is an automated feature engineering process that generates new variables by extracting them from the raw data. The main aim of this step is to reduce the volume of data so that it can be easily used and managed for data modelling. Feature extraction methods include cluster analysis, text analytics, edge detection algorithms, and principal components analysis (PCA).
Feature Selection: While developing the machine learning model, only a few variables in the dataset are useful for building the model, and the rest features are either redundant or irrelevant. If we input the dataset with all these redundant and irrelevant features, it may negatively impact and reduce the overall performance and accuracy of the model. Hence it is very important to identify and select the most appropriate features from the data and remove the irrelevant or less important features, which is done with the help of feature selection in machine learning. "Feature selection is a way of selecting the subset of the most relevant features from the original features set by removing the redundant, irrelevant, or noisy features."
Below are some benefits of using feature selection in machine learning:

It helps in avoiding the curse of dimensionality.
It helps in the simplification of the model so that the researchers can easily interpret it.
It reduces the training time.
It reduces overfitting hence enhancing the generalization.
Need for Feature Engineering in Machine Learning
In machine learning, the performance of the model depends on data pre-processing and data handling. But if we create a model without pre-processing or data handling, then it may not give good accuracy. Whereas, if we apply feature engineering on the same model, then the accuracy of the model is enhanced. Hence, feature engineering in machine learning improves the model's performance. Below are some points that explain the need for feature engineering:

Better features mean flexibility.
In machine learning, we always try to choose the optimal model to get good results. However, sometimes after choosing the wrong model, still, we can get better predictions, and this is because of better features. The flexibility in features will enable you to select the less complex models. Because less complex models are faster to run, easier to understand and maintain, which is always desirable.
Better features mean simpler models.
If we input the well-engineered features to our model, then even after selecting the wrong parameters (Not much optimal), we can have good outcomes. After feature engineering, it is not necessary to do hard for picking the right model with the most optimized parameters. If we have good features, we can better represent the complete data and use it to best characterize the given problem.
Better features mean better results.
As already discussed, in machine learning, as data we will provide will get the same output. So, to obtain better results, we must need to use better features.
Steps in Feature Engineering
The steps of feature engineering may vary as per different data scientists and ML engineers. However, there are some common steps that are involved in most machine learning algorithms, and these steps are as follows:

Data Preparation: The first step is data preparation. In this step, raw data acquired from different resources are prepared to make it in a suitable format so that it can be used in the ML model. The data preparation may contain cleaning of data, delivery, data augmentation, fusion, ingestion, or loading.
Exploratory Analysis: Exploratory analysis or Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an important step of features engineering, which is mainly used by data scientists. This step involves analysis, investing data set, and summarization of the main characteristics of data. Different data visualization techniques are used to better understand the manipulation of data sources, to find the most appropriate statistical technique for data analysis, and to select the best features for the data.
Benchmark: Benchmarking is a process of setting a standard baseline for accuracy to compare all the variables from this baseline. The benchmarking process is used to improve the predictability of the model and reduce the error rate.
